- Needed to install/build from source opencv with gstreamer enabled
- followed steps from diverse sources including https://medium.com/@arfanmahmud47/build-opencv-4-from-source-with-gstreamer-ubuntu-zorin-peppermint-c2cff5393ef
- Once built, need to add the .so built file into the site-packages for the corresponding venv
- the cam_tests.py shows a template code which was able to open the libcamera video stream for the csi camera
- for camera to work sometimes need to have it connected then boot the raspi with it connected
